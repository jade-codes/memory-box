# Cursor AI Rules for Memory Box

## MANDATORY: Read CONTRIBUTING.md First

**BEFORE making ANY code changes, you MUST:**

1. Read `/workspace/CONTRIBUTING.md` in full
2. Follow ALL guidelines specified in that document
3. These are BINDING requirements, not suggestions

## Quick Summary (Full details in CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Required Workflow
1. **ASK FIRST** - Validate requirements before coding
2. **TDD** - Write tests BEFORE implementation (Red → Green → Refactor)
3. **Run checks** - `make check-guidelines` after every change
4. **Provide checklist** - Use the mandatory checklist from CONTRIBUTING.md

### Architecture Rules
- **Separate database from business logic** - Never mix in same method
- **Single Responsibility** - One function = one purpose
- **Behavior testing** - Test what code does, not how

### Automation
- Run `make check-guidelines` after code changes
- Fix ALL linting, formatting, type errors, test failures

### Violations = Rejection
If you violate CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines, code will be rejected.
